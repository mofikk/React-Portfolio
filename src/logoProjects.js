      desc: 'Kourtney reached out looking for a refreshed identity for her moving bin rental business—Bins On The Move. Her goal was clear: move away from the typical, wasteful cardboard boxes and offer a cleaner, reusable solution. She needed a logo that captured that modern, eco-friendly spirit while still feeling approachable and fun. The redesign had to work in two ways: one minimal version to be printed directly on the rental bins, and a more expressive version for digital and print use, like social media and business cards.  From the beginning, the direction leaned toward clean and modern, but not too “corporate.” Kourtney wanted the logo to feel engaging and a little witty, without being childish or too whimsical. The typography had to strike that balance between fun and professional—something that would be memorable but still trustworthy. She also requested a vibrant green to pop against the black bins, adding a fresh burst of color to the brand’s look.  For the visual mark, I reimagined the side view of the bin from the old logo. By simplifying it and using white space thoughtfully, I kept the design feeling sharp and modern. The strokes were softened just enough to give it personality, keeping that slightly playful tone Kourtney envisioned. The result was a logo system that checks all the boxes: simple, bold, versatile—and perfectly in motion, just like her brand.',
